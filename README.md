# Spring is NEAR: Challenge 5: GiveWell Donation



## Instruction for cloners.

The first thing is to bundle install stuff. We only want non production. 

```
bundle config set --local without production
bundle install
```

The second thing is to recreate master key and credentials. 

```
EDITOR="code ." bin/rails credentials:edit
```

**Close the file.** Then run migrations:

```
rails db:migrate
```

Then we need to install bootstrap. (Ignore the error, it'll auto install upon cannot find bootstrap). 
This requires yarn and node js. 

```
bash rebuild.sh
```

Everything should be fine after that. Try to start `rails s` and see if it starts or not. 

```
rails s
```

Everything should be fine after that. Try to start `rails s` and see if it starts or not.
